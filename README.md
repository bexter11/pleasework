So it seems that I can edit stuff on this website, and not just from the command line...interesting. Well anyways,
it's always frustrating learning something new, but when that thing consistently fails...well that just makes your 
day. All I wanna do is finish the simple instructions for making a repository. I tried the steps on the page we were
linked to from the email and they didn't work. And well, that really lifts your spirit, you know. I think I'm 
stalling on this read me file because I'm scared of finishing this only to have it fail again. Ok. I guess now is as 
good a time as any to stop being a baby and continue. So if it's as good a time as any, then why not do it later. 
There's that logic for ya!! I think I will get some more thoughts out before I stop this. Some things that make me 
happy about this github thing. There is an option for text wrapping (even though I'm not using it right now) and my
mouse is accounted for in the design (I can click to move the cursor!!)!! Some bad things now. New things frighten me. 
I don't like the unknown, and I don't like to depend on people, unless it's something I really don't care about. I do 
like learning new things, but maybe not under so much pressure. Ok, enough time has passed. Let's go...
